Data Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Each NHGIS land cover summary file provides land cover data summarized for geographic units in a geographic level (e.g., county, census tract, place, and core-based statistical area). 


The land cover summary file name indicates which geographic level, year, and the file type are included in the file:


* Time varies by file:
   * US_[geographic level]_[geographic level year]_nlcd_[land cover year].csv


* Time varies by column:
   * US_[geographic_level]_nlcd_[land cover year].csv




Geographic level codes:


        tr - Census tract
        co - County
        pl - Place
        cbsa - Core-based statistical area




Environmental summaries file content:


Time varies by file: 
* The first row is a header row
* Each subsequent row represents a geographic unit
* The GISJOIN field contains NHGIS-standard identifiers
* GEOGYEAR field represents the source year of the shapefile
* NLCDYEAR field represents the source year of the land cover raster
* The frac_[land cover class] fields are the proportions of the area covered by the land cover class[b]


Time varies by column: 
* The first row is a header row
* Each subsequent row represents a geographic unit
* The GISJOIN field contains NHGIS-standard identifiers
* GEOGYEAR field represents the source year of the shapefile
* The frac_[land cover class]_[land cover year] fields are the proportions of the area covered by the land cover class for the given GISJOIN[c] in the land cover source year

Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following process was used to create the land cover summaries:


1. Download the land cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) (https://www.mrlc.gov).
2. Download the GIS file(s) for the geographic units for which environmental summaries will be calculated. 
3. Calculate the fraction (or proportion) of each geographic unit’s area covered by a given land cover class.         




Additional documentation on the R scripts used is available at: https://www.nhgis.org/environmental-summaries.

[b]should the total area be added?? like how the summaries were previously made? 


I remember talking about not putting them in a meeting, but might be easier to convert them to area if necessary??
[c]wording
[d]capitalize them?? change name to PROP??
[e]I haven't yet decided about this yet! I'm tempted to leave them lowercase.
[f]change the script to remove this??
[g]I need to look at the output files and see if any geographic units have values in this field. If they do, we'll need to retain frac_0 and provide a name for it.
[h]As far as I know, none of the output have any data in frac_0 column, if we want I can check them quickly and remove them if they seem unnecessary.
